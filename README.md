# Ciphers
This program was built in C++ and is able to encrypt/decrypt messages using 4 different ciphers.
<br>
This repository comes with a few sample files you can use. To make new ones, simply create a text file and format your messages in a similar fashion of the existing text files.
<br>
The program supports 4 different ciphers: Caesar, Rail Fence, Vigen√®re, and Onglong.
<br>
Since this project uses multi-file compilation, a makefile is attached to make it easier to compile and run.
